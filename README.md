# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple yet comprehensive Tic-Tac-Toe game for iOS, written in Swift. 

This iOS application uses a MVC framework. 

### DEMO
<div>
<img src = "markdown_assets/new_game.jpg" style = "width: 50px" />
<img src = "markdown_assets/x's_turn.jpg" style = "width: 50px" />
<img src = "markdown_assets/x_wins.jpg" style = "width: 50px" />
</div>

In the future I will create an AI that plays a user. I will also extend this to be compatible with iOS Messages.
